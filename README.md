# ArcGIS-JavaScript-Webmap-Tool
The map tool takes in .csv (comma delimited) files with latitudinal and longitudinal points in decimal degrees and displays it on a map. 
The displayed point's shape, color, size can then be changed. Colors can also be changed by attributes within 
appropriate fields with three different color sets. If the points are colored by attributes then a legend depicting 
those attributes and colors can be enabled. The map can execute simple querying (e.g. one field & one attribute).
If a date/time field is detected and the listed data has appropriate date/time formatting then the data can be queried
with a time range. There are nine basemaps provided by esri that the user can select. The toolbar can be moved (Click 
and hold the top of the toolbar), hidden (Click hide at the bottom of the toolbar), and redisplayed (mouse over the
toolbar's last position).

## Note:
This is the **first** applicaion I created a few weeks after starting to learn HTLM/CSS/JavaScript. The code does not utilize proper separation of concerns making it very difficult to build on from.
